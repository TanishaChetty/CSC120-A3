I worked with my classmates Faith Kwon and Etta Applefeld. I also talked to Miriam Pennock who took this class last semester. I attended the TA hours on 2/17 from 7-9pm. Java is pretty confusing, but I think I'm starting to understand the format a little bit. Mostly, I'm just realizing how easy it is to mix up the different languages, especially as I'm just starting to learn Java. I wish I had started the assignment earlier, but so it goes! I'll be sure to start the next assignment STAT.
